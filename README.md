The editor is written in Rust and it uses the [egui](https://egui.rs) + eframe framework.

## Installation

1 - Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, you can install it by following the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).
2 - Clone this repository.
3 - Run `cargo run --release` in the root of the repository.

## Usage

The editor lets you create and edit DrumGen templates. You can create new templates, load existing ones, and save them to disk as .hex files.

Each template contains 32-step probability sequences for 4 parts with 3 velocity layers each that can be edited using the sliders.  
Additional features include the ability to randomize layers (with adjustable random settings) and shift the sequence back and forth.

It's also possible to edit multiple steps in the same layer at once by holding down numbers 1-8 on the keyboard while dragging the sliders.

*Attention*: DrumGen HEX filenames must have at most 8 characters and the .hex extension (e.g. `drum0001.hex`).
